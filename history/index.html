        <td><p>1. Black Codes</p></td>
        <td>The Black Codes were laws <br>created be the Southern states <br>shortly after rejoining the Union. <br>These laws limited the rights and <br>freedoms of the newly freed slaves.</td>
        <td>I think the Black Codes were <br>immoral and unfair.</td>

        <td id='2'>2. Thirteenth Amendment</td>
        <td>The Thirteenth Amendment abolished <br>slavery, exept as a punishment for crime. </td>
        <td>I think the Thirteenth Amendment was the <br>largest step in making the United States what <br>it currently is.</td>

        <td id='3'>3. Fourteenth Amendment</td>
        <td>The Fourteenth Amendment made <br>everyone born in this country a citizen, <br>and stated that no one could be punished <br>without having broken the law. </td>
        <td>I think the Fourteenth Amandment further <br>eradicated slavery by disabling peoples' <br>ability to punish other people with slavery <br>without them having commited a crime.</td>

        <td id='4'>4. Fifteenth Amendment</td>
        <td>The Fifteenth Amendment made all <br>citizens able to vote.</td>

        <td id='5'>5. Lincoln's ten percent plan</td>
        <td>The Ten-percent plan allowed states to join <br>the union if at least 10 percent of their <br>population became U.S. citizens.</td>
        <td>I think the Ten-percent Plan was necessary for new <br>states to be effective in electing national leaders. </td>
