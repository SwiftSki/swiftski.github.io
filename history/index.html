        <td><p>1. Black Codes</p></td>
        <td>The Black Codes were laws created be the Southern states shortly after rejoining the Union. These laws limited the rights and freedoms of the newly freed slaves.</td>
        <td>I think the Black Codes were immoral and unfair.</td>

        <td><p>2. Thirteenth Amendment</p> <img src="Emancipation.jpg" alt="Emancipation Proclamation" /></td>
        <td>The Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery, exept as a punishment for crime. </td>
        <td>I think the Thirteenth Amendment was the largest step in making the United States what is currently is.</td>

      <tr>
        <td><p>3. Fourteenth Amendment</p> <img src="14th.jpg" alt="" /></td>
        <td>The Fourteenth Amendment made everyone born in this country a citizen, and stated that no one could be punished without having broken the law. </td>
        <td>I think the Fourteenth Amandment further eradicated slavery by disabling peoples' ability to punish other people with slavery without them having commited a crime.</td>

        <td><p>4. Fifteenth Amendment</p> <img src="15th.jpg" alt="" /></td>
        <td>The Fifteenth Amendment made all citizens able to vote.</td>
        <td>I think the Fifteenth Amendment is great because it allows all people to be represented.</td>

        <td><p>5. Lincoln's ten perrcent plan</p> <img src="Constitution.jpg" alt="U.S. constitution" /></td>
        <td>The Ten-percent plan allowed states to join the union if at least 10 percent of their population became U.S. citizens.</td>
        <td>I think the Ten-percent Plan was necessary for new states to be effective in electing national leaders. </td>
